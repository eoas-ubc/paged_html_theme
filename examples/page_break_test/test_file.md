1. A “greybody” has a temperature of 240 K and we measure the flux
   radiating from it over all wavelengths to be 75 $W\,m^{-2}$.
   What is its greybody emissivity ε?

   A)  about 0.35  
   B)  about 0.40  
   C)  about 0.50  
   D)  about 0.65  
   E)  about 0.85  


2. Two objects have different temperatures. Body A has a temperature of
   300 K and emissivity ε=0.2, whereas Body B has a temperature of 240
   K but has an emissivity of ε=0.75. Which of the following statements
   is correct regarding the radiation flux?

   A)  Body A emits more flux than Body B  
   B)  Neither object emits radiation  
   C)  Both emit roughly the same amount  
   D)  Body B emits more flux than Body A  
   E)  Not enough information  


3. Use the figure below to estimate the radiative flux emitted by a
   300 K blackbody in the wavelength range 15 to 20 $\mu m$.

   A) between 10-40 $W\,m^{-2}$  
   B) between 40-70 $W\,m^{-2}$  
   C) between 70-100  $W\,m^{-2}$  
   D) between 100-130 $W\,m^{-2}$  
   E) between 130-160 $W\,m^{-2}$

4. We measure the flux being emitted from a blackbody with a infrared
   camera and find the blackbody is emitting 12 $W\,m^{-2}\,\mu m^{-1}$
   at wavelength $\lambda = 10\ \mu m$. Using the Planck
   function diagram from question 3 above, what do you estimate for the
   temperature of the blackbody?

   A)  210 K  
   B)  230 K  
   C)  250 K  
   D)  270 K  
   E)  290 K  


5. A beam of light with a flux of 150 $W\,m^{-2}$ shines on a wall
   with an emissivity ε = 0.2 and a transmissivity tr = 0.5. How much
   of the beam is absorbed, reflected, and transmitted by the wall?

   A)  45 $W\,m^{-2}$ absorbed; 60 $W\,m^{-2}$ transmitted; 45 $W\,m^{-2}$ reflected  
   B)  30 $W\,m^{-2}$ absorbed; 45 $W\,m^{-2}$ transmitted; 75 $W\,m^{-2}$ reflected  
   C)  75 $W\,m^{-2}$ absorbed; 45 $W\,m^{-2}$ transmitted; 35 $W\,m^{-2}$ reflected  
   D)  75 $W\,m^{-2}$ absorbed; 45 $W\,m^{-2}$ transmitted; 30 $W\,m^{-2}$ reflected  
   E)  50 $W\,m^{-2}$ absorbed; 65 $W\,m^{-2}$ transmitted;  35 $W\,m^{-2}$ reflected
