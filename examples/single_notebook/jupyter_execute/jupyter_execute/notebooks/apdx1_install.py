-   Macs

    There are dozens of different flavors of shell. One of these is the
    bash shell; if you have a Mac, then you already have a bash shell,
    which you can launch from spotlight by typing âŒ˜-space (i.e. press
    the "command" key together with the a space, then type the word
    "terminal" into the spotlight search bar).
